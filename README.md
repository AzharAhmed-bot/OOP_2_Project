It is an innovative application designed to help students manage their coursework and academic studies with unparalleled efficiency. StudyBud allows users to input their course units, which the program then ranks in terms of priority based on deadlines, difficulty, and personal preferences. By analysing the user's energy levels throughout the day, StudyBud creates a personalized study schedule that optimizes peak productivity times for tackling challenging tasks and allocates less demanding work to lower energy periods.

This dynamic scheduling ensures an even distribution of study hours across all units, preventing burnout and promoting balanced progress. StudyBud also offers flexibility, enabling users to reschedule or delete tasks as needed, adapting to the ever-changing demands of academic life.

Notably, the application tracks and records all changes and navigation within the terminal, providing a detailed log of user activity. This feature helps students reflect on their study habits and make informed adjustments. With StudyBud, academic planning becomes a streamlined process, allowing students to focus on their studies with a clear, structured approach.
